# Memories of Self-Care & Literature

A one-person passion project, Memories of Self-Care & Literature (SCL for short) is a submod for MAS looking to provide a good chunk of quality writing to all areas of the game!

While it doesn't introduce any new mini-games or new gameplay mechanics, MAS provides new content for all existing parts of the game where writing can be added- from songs, new questions, and moods but also a wide range of light-hearted and interesting topics.

To encourage the dynamics of a blossoming and changing relationship, MAS's content unlocks steadily as you increase Monika's affection.

And as the two of you progress through your relationship, you can unlock topics with Monika with random elements that change every time you view them!

From hearing the inane ramblings of a distracted Monika (implimented as of base SCL) to flirting terribly with bad pick-up lines (to be implimented in a future update!) SCL makes Monika more dynamic than ever!

How will Monika change during her time with you? And how can your relationship influence her? 

And in the spirit of DDLC and DDLC+, there's.. perhaps some interesting background to this mod, here and there?

Installation:

Download files; put into new folder labelled 'Submods' which in turn should be in MAS's 'Game' directory, alongside the "Mod_assets" folder and all the scripts for MAS.
