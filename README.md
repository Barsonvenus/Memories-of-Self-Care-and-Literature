# Memories of Self-Care & Literature

A one-person passion project, Memories of Self-Care & Literature (SCL for short) provides new personally written content for all existing parts of the game where writing can be added- from songs, new questions, and moods but also a wide range of light-hearted and interesting topics. 

This mod currently includes over 72 new topics in total to discuss, 4 songs, 2 Compliments, 10 window reacts, 8 new intros, 17 farewells, and 6 new moods to talk about in the 'I feel' menu for those tricky times in life.

To encourage the dynamics of a blossoming and changing relationship, SCL's content unlocks steadily as you increase Monika's affection.

And as the two of you progress through your relationship, you can unlock topics with Monika with random elements that change every time you view them!

From hearing the inane ramblings of a distracted Monika, flirting terribly with bad pick-up lines, or trying to surprise Monika when she's unaware, SCL makes Monika more dynamic than ever!

How will Monika change during her time with you? And how can your relationship influence her? 

And in the spirit of DDLC and DDLC+, there's.. perhaps some interesting background to this mod, here and there?

# Installation:

Download source code; in MAS's 'Game' directory (calongside the "Mod_assets" folder and all the scripts for MAS), make sure there is a 'Submods' folder (Create if needed.) Unzip the source code in this folder and Make sure SCL is in a folder of it's own inside the 'Submods' folder.

The end result is that your directory has a 'game' folder; in it a 'submods' folder; and then a folder containing the contents of this submod.

Auto-updater version requires Booplicate's [Submod Updater Plugin](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin) otherwise you will encounter a error upon booting up the game.

This submod was originally created with MAS version 12.8; earlier versions are not guarenteed to work with SCL.
