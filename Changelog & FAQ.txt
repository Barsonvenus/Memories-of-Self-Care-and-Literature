Change Notes

4.2.0
(Improvements upon Self-Care & Literature)
- 19 events, 3 window reacts
- Events are mostly anniversary based; 4 depends on affection levels (as a seamless way to alert you to affection changes) and each anniversary milestone now has a second event tied to it
- I figured out how semantic numbering works

4.0.0
(Recollect Self-Care & Literature) 

- 14 new topics, 2 songs, 1 compliment, 1 window react
- various typos/grammar fixes
- couple of topics have been rewritten for better flow
- monika can yell. or, you can yell with monika. just shout.. whatever.
- oh man, writing these changelogs are fun because i can be like 'yell with monika' is a feature and it's like, 'okay????'
- that's great

3.0.0
(Tales of Self & Literature)

- 16 new topics, 2 intros, and 10 farewells added
- "Ask the time" topic has been modified to get across that "Could you tell me the time?" may not be available until later boot-ups
- Overide label for "Favourite Word" topic as missing unlocked=True 
- Various typos/missing 'm' sprite indicators added back in
- I'm going to keep it real with you. I'm still not sure how semantic versioning works.

2.0.2

- 'Surprise Her' event code further fixed to accommodate wrong event reference/overrides old event
- new topic 'Unsurprising' to unlock 'Surprise Her' to keep with SCL's 'unlock one topic, unlock the other' format
- If you are still getting issues, you can run 'Unsurprising' again to choose to push 'Surprise Her' as a topic, and you can keep trying until it'll unlock properly.   
- Current repeatable SCL unlock events will have a backdoor like this incorporated/future events as well as a precauction.

2.0.1

- wrong event conditional fix changed to unlock 'Surprise her' topic; thanks to L0l8it on Reddit for finding this.

2.0.0
(Reconsile Self & Literature)

- wait, theres like a new version of ren'py? i didnt get the memo on this, do i gotta recode everything or
- i wrote this joke and update like months ago so this joke now makes less sense

- 18 new topics; bringing the total to 40 topics with this submod!

- unlock the ability to Flirt badly with Monika. No, seriously, the option is literally labelled 'Flirt (badly).'
- unlock the ability to ask Monika the time. No, seriously, the option is literally labelled 'Ask Monika the time.'
- For those who are a little more playful, you can flirt with Monika or ask her the time immediately upon opening the game; she'll make a comment on you choosing those options right away.

1.0.2

(intial release)

- all of the code is being written in regular notepad and i'm pretty sure that's a sin why is someone screaming at me from a distance
- 22 new topics in total to discuss! Talk about vegan diets, makeup, hating literally all of humanity! 2 songs, 8 + 1? ? ? window reacts, 6 new intros (which change depending if she's said it more than once!), 7 farewells, 5 new moods to talk about in the 'I feel' menu for those tricky times in life.

- uh, i guess the most interesting part of this is that you can stare at Monika
- no this is not as creepy as it sounds trust me
- there's nuance involved, i swear
- over 20 different observations to make!

- monika can be scatter-brained at times, huh?
- i guess if you can note 'absent-mindedness' as a feature, then.. it's a feature

FAQ

Q: Just to be clear, I'm a disembodied strawman for you to ask and answer your own questions, right?
A: Yes.

Q: What's the expected writing style of this mod?
A:	(Note that these bullet points may not all apply to existing content)
-	Relatively serious. Memes dank but I don't write them in for the most part
-	THere are no specific trigger warnings to give that aren't already covered by this mod/base DDLC.
- 	DDLC+ is canon; Monika is *not* aware of the meta-content of DDLC+. The meta-narrative of this submod ties into that. 
-	Monika’s existence and the details of how she interacts with her world are mostly obscure. For instance, her sleep is alluded to in the original game, being an unpleasant, out of body experience. 
-	In this vein, Monika will never overtly discuss her existence in plain terms in length; she'll try to pivot the conversation in another direction if it gets too self-involved. Careful balance and tact is considered whenever she talks about ‘coding,’ the game, etc. 
-	Monika won’t reference aspects of fandom often, if at all.
-	Monika can be unintentionally condescending towards ideas/subjects she’s not personally knowledgeable about.
-	While not the case for every event, on average events are longer than what you would see in base MAS.
- 	There are no triggers for a despondent Monika. This submod assumes you care for her greatly.

-	If you reciprocate her feelings, Monika will love you with all her heart.
	But you'll never figure out what she's thinking, not truly.


Q: Will this break my game?
A: Play it safe. As per guidelines recommended by MAS devs, All new topics have undergone moderate testing, and to accomodate my dumbassery in coding, events do not change affection and I've tried not to rely on important code.
This being said, with the amount of code involved, this may potentially rank as one of the more involved submods that adds content to MAS, so please keep this in mind.
In either case, there's never harm in making backups of your current game, and I encourage you to do because Monika does ask nicely, and to do so before adding any submod to be extra safe.

Q: Is all the content unlockable from the start?
A: No. It's been partially designed to encourage topics/questions unlocking after you've already discussed certain topics/questions, topics at this time are only unlocked once Monika is comfortable enough to open up to you more to mirror the progression the original mod has; any future updates will most likely have contributions in this nature.
Right now, the progression tiers for events with random variables and are meant to be repeated & seen multiple times as arranged by affection: 

Happy: Catch her distracted, Yell w/ Monika (Already coded, TBA)
Affectionate: Surprise, Sneak A Peek
Enamored: Flirt (Badly,) (Already coded, TBA) Ask Time (Already coded, TBA)
Love: Roleplay (No, not like.. not like that) (TBA) ????? ???????? ??????? (This is the absolute peak of this mod, imo) (TBA)

These events also have multiple timers (some have changed dialogue depending if you do it immediately upon opening the game, or have cooldown periods between each attempt.)

Q: What's with the name?
A: It was a 2AM in the morning sort of idea, but I'm sticking to it as I kinda like how hokey it sounds. It's meant to accompany "Dreams of Love and Literature" and "Stories of Friendship and Literature."

Q: Could I use this stuff in my own mod?
A: This is a weird question even in the style of me making up a fake Q&A, but this is me saying that if you ever want to adapt this garbage code/incorporate this own writing in your submod, please feel free for the sake of preservation/community efforts. You don't even need to give credit. It'd be nice, though.

Q: This seems a fair amount of effort. Why not submit this through offical channels/pull requests on GitHub?
A: If I have a bit of time and figure out how GitHub works, I'm inclined to send in some of my work.
But aside from creative liberties that might not work with the original/other submods, I have literally no prior expierence in coding, and my motiviation, like many writers, comes and goes. In the spirit of the community, I'd rather release this for public usage even in a simple state for everyone to enjoy.

Q: Any future plans for this submod?
A: Sure, but they're hampered by- what else- a lack of coding skill. I'd love to do events where Monika is in a special 'sick' or 'away' state locking you from regular conversation until the events are resolved, but I couldn't tell you if I could create even 1% of these events.

Q: Can I help?
A: I appreciate it, but at this time unless you have a fair amount of expierence w/ Ren'Py, I am not accepting submissions for topics.

Q: You suck, and this mod sucks
A: Considering the former: In principle, yes. For the latter, if you have any constructive feedback/bug reports please feel free to reach out.

===========

This project was the result of writing as a hobby; I mostly learned how to make this mod by reverse-engineering current MAS work and documentation, Ren'py questions on Lemma Soft Forums, Stackoverflow, and the MAS community. 
There's nobody to specifically thank (in part because I've forgotten where exactly I've dug up some code, for instance the weighted choices code which I remember from being Lemma Soft, but I'm not 100% how original it is.)
So I would want to give a blanket thanks for the all users on those specific communities and really only claim ownership of the writing itself (I'm happy to specifically attribute if needed.)
